This is a hobby project made by Edgar ([edgargomez.es](https://edgargomez.es)) using React Native, Typescript, PokeAPI, a bit of CSS and some fun. There is also a web app version made using Nextjs.

You can check both repositories here: [React Native Pokedex](https://github.com/EdgarGomez/Pokedex-React-Native) and [Nextjs Pokedex](https://github.com/EdgarGomez/Pokedex).
